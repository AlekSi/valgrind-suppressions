What is it?
===========

This tool will help you to generate suppression files for Valgrind's tool
Memcheck (http://valgrind.org/info/tools.html#memcheck).

One day I found myself in searching memory leaks in big complex project. The
main problem was that it has very old Linux kernel and system libraries with
brain-dead patches. Memcheck's output was filled with leaks and errors in deep
levels, not in our project itself. Since I wasn't able to do anything with
this, I created this tool.


How?
====

Idea is simple: you write a small chunk of code that reproduce this leaks and
errors inside third-party libraries, then run it through Memcheck and get
suppression file. Collecting this chunks is the main goal of this project.

Usage
=====

rake build_debug (or build_release)
rake generate
./run-memcheck <program> <args for program>
